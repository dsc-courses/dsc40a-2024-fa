        "\n",
        "In this exercise, you will explore how adding more data points can improve a linear regression model. The task involves generating data from a linear model, adding noise, and analyzing how the model's fit improves as the number of data points increases.\n",

        "$y = \\alpha x + \\beta$\n",

This does not mean that all the data points fall on the same exact line, but it does mean that a scatterplot of the data shows a general trend that seems to be increasing linearly. One way to generate data that would be appropriate for linear regression is to find points that fall on the same straight line, then bump those points up or down by a small amount.\n",
