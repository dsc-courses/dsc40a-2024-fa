##### Lecture 14

# More Combinatorics Examples

#### DSC 40A, Summer 2024

---

### Announcements

- Homework 6 is due on **Thursday at 11:59PM**.
  - Combinatorics is hard! Come to office hours.

---

### Agenda

- Example: Selecting students.
- Example: An unfair coin.
- Example: Poker.
- Example: Chess.

Remember, we've posted **many** probability resources on the [resources tab of the course website](https://dsc40a.com/resources/#probability). These will come in handy! Specific resources you should look at:
- The [DSC 40A probability roadmap](https://dsc40a.com/resources/#probability-roadmap), written by Janine Tiefenbruck.
- The textbook [Theory Meets Data](http://stat88.org/textbook/content/intro.html), which explains many of the same ideas and contains more practice problems.

**For combinatorics specifically, there are two supplementary videos I created that you should watch. Both are linked in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDNbnocpJUhaMR08k5YBu3AXsZxTcUWsy), which is also linked at [dsc40a.com](https://dsc40a.com)**.

### Summary

Suppose we want to select $k$ elements from a group of $n$ possible elements. The following table summarizes whether the problem involves sequences, permutations, or combinations, along with the number of relevant orderings.


|  | Yes, order matters | No, order doesn't matter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **With replacement**<br><small>Repetition allowed</small> | $\boxed{n^k}$ possible **sequences**  | more complicated: watch [**this video**](https://youtu.be/epY_8lcKxCU?si=qFOwGWI4UzkWoE9J), or see the domino example |
| **Without replacement**<br><small>Repetition not allowed</small> | $\boxed{\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}}$ possible **permutations** | $\boxed{n \choose k}$ **combinations** |


---

### Using the binomial coefficient, ${n \choose k}$

As an example, let's evaluate:

$${9 \choose 2} + {9 \choose 3}$$

---


### Combinatorics as a tool for probability

- If $S$ is a sample space consisting of equally-likely outcomes, and $A$ is an event, then $\mathbb{P}(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|}$.

- In many examples, this will boil down to using permutations and/or combinations to count $|A|$ and $|S|$.
- **Tip**: Before starting a probability problem, always think about what the sample space $S$ is!

### Overview: Selecting students

We're going answer the same question using several different techniques.
    
**There are 20 students in a class. Avi is one of them. Suppose we select 5 students in the class uniformly at random **without replacement**. What is the probability that Avi is among the 5 selected students?**
    
---

### Selecting students
#### Method 1: Using permutations
    
There are 20 students in a class. Avi is one of them. Suppose we select 5 students in the class uniformly at random **without replacement**. What is the probability that Avi is among the 5 selected students?

### Selecting students
#### Method 2: Using permutations and the complement
    
There are 20 students in a class. Avi is one of them. Suppose we select 5 students in the class uniformly at random **without replacement**. What is the probability that Avi is among the 5 selected students?

### Selecting students
#### Method 3: Using combinations
    
There are 20 students in a class. Avi is one of them. Suppose we select 5 students in the class uniformly at random **without replacement**. What is the probability that Avi is among the 5 selected students?

### Selecting students
#### Method 4: The "easy" way
    
There are 20 students in a class. Avi is one of them. Suppose we select 5 students in the class uniformly at random **without replacement**. What is the probability that Avi is among the 5 selected students?

### Question ü§î
**Answer at [q.dsc40a.com](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEaSAGovXZCk_51_CVI587CcGW1GZH1w4Y50dKDzoLEX3D4w/viewform)**

#### With vs. without replacement

We've determined that a probability that a random sample of 5 students from a class of 20 **without replacement** contains Avi (one student in particular) is $\frac{1}{4}$.
    
Suppose we instead sampled **with replacement**. Would the resulting probability be equal to, greater than, or less than $\frac{1}{4}$?
        
- A. Equal to.
- B. Greater than.
- C. Less than.

## Example: An unfair coin

---

### Followup: An unfair coin

In the video you were asked to watch, we flipped an **unfair** coin 10 times, where the coin was biased such that for each flip, $\mathbb{P}(\text{heads}) = \frac{1}{3}$.

1. What is the probability that we see the specific sequence HHHHTTTTTT?<br><br><br><br>
2. What is the probability that we see exactly 4 heads?

### Followup: An unfair coin

3. What is the probability that we see exactly $k$ heads, where $0 \leq k \leq 10$?<br><br><br><br><br>
4. What is the probability that we see _at least_ $k$ heads, where $0 \leq k \leq 10$?

## Example: Poker

### Deck of cards

- There are **52** cards in a standard deck.
- Each card has a suit (4 possibilities) and a value (13 possibilities).

- In poker, each player is dealt 5 cards, called a **hand**. The order of cards in a hand does not matter.

2. How many 5 card hands are there where all cards are of the same suit (i.e. a "flush")?

3. How many 5 card hands are there that include four cards of the same value (i.e. a "four-of-a-kind")?

4. How many 5 card hands are there that have all card values consecutive (i.e. a "straight")?

5. How many 5 card hands are there that have all card values consecutive and of the same suit (i.e. a "straight flush")?

## Example: Chess

---

### Chess pieces

(Source: [Spring 2023 Midterm 2, Problem 3](https://practice.dsc40a.com/sp23-midterm2/index.html#problem-3))

A set of chess pieces has 32 pieces. 16 of these are black and 16 of these are white. **In each color**, the 16 pieces are:

<br>

<center>
8 pawns, 2 bishops, 2 knights, 2 rooks, 1 queen, and 1 king
</center>

<br>

When there are multiple pieces of a given color and type (for example, 
8 white pawns), we will assume they are **indistinguishable** from one another.

In this problem, a **lineup** is a way of arranging items in a straight line.

---

### Chess pieces

1. A chess player lines up all 16 **white pieces** from the set of chess pieces. How many different-looking lineups can be created? Remember, some pieces look the same.

---

### Chess pieces

2. A chess player lines up all 16 **pawns** from the set of chess pieces. How many lineups have white pawns on both ends?

---

### Chess pieces

3. A chess player lines up all 16 **pawns** from the set of chess pieces. Assuming that each different-looking lineup is equally likely, what is the probability that the lineup has two of the same-colored pawns on both ends (both black or both white)?
