- Go over the lecture slides/ your notes to review all the concepts. If there‚Äôs any concept you have trouble with, rewatch that lecture to get a clearer idea. 
    - If you still have trouble grasping the concept, go to office hours.
- Look over and redo all homework and groupwork problems in order of their release. 
    - If your answers and the solutions do not match, ask on Ed / Office hours whether your approach is correct
- Do practice exams in an exam-like environment. No music, a set time limit, no external distractions(phone, iPad), and do the exam on paper.
    - If your solutions do not match up with the actual solutions, try to go over your explanations and see where you went wrong.
- If you are not confident in any of the topics, redo problems from those topics from the practice site.
