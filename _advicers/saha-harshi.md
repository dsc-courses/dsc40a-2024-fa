- Go through items in order of when they were released / due:
    - Read through annotated lecture slides for each week
    - Then read through the solutions on that week‚Äôs content
        - For group works, read the question, try to solve it in your head / think of the setup to the solution and think about what steps you need to get to the answer
        - Look at the actual answer, if the setup aligns with what you thought of, move on. If not, read through the actual solution and make sure it makes sense, enough that you are confident you will not mess up a similar problem if you saw it.
        - Do the same for homeworks!
- Do the same method for going through past exam problems and setting up solutions / comparing to the actual solution using the practice site
