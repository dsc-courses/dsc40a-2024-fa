- Form study groups when studying for exams and when doing homework assignments. There are times when your friends have a different approach from you. You can learn from them if their approach is more efficient. If it turns out that your approach is more efficient, then you earn an opportunity to teach your friends. Not only will explaining your approach help your friends learn, it also reinforces and solidifies your understanding of the concepts applied to the problems that you are trying to solve. 
- When stuck with a specific problem, think about the simpler case of that problem:
    - Ex: CAVOCADO problem. If you are having trouble proving the given answer, start from computing the number of permutations of CAVO, then CAVOC, and so on. 
- Do practice problems and show up at office hours!
