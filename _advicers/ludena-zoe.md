I know generically a tip for doing better on exams is ‚Äúlooking at lecture and doing practice problems,‚Äù but I add a little bit of spice to these ideas. Looking over the lecture is fine, but trying to re-group topics together on your own and writing it out can really benefit you! For example, I would take the time to group together my notes on empirical risk and loss. Perhaps add in some notes if I struggled with derivative rules. Another way I study is working with my friends. We would go over practice problems, class problems, and lectures together. Sometimes I struggle with things that others do not or am better at those things than them. Teaching people is a fantastic way to demonstrate your understanding of a topic. Teaching anyone can help, even people who do not know the material! It forces you to know the topic.
