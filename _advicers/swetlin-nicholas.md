Draw lots of pictures! Be able to draw out loss functions, empirical risk, gradient descent, probability spaces, combinatorics! Don‚Äôt just stare at your pictures; ask questions about them! Can I label everything in this picture? What is missing from this diagram? Steal free pictures from the web and gain dozens of new perspectives on a topic! Then, explain all of them to your friends and parents, people who presumably know nothing about data science! You know you‚Äôre doing enough when you‚Äôre falling asleep at night and your brain all of a sudden says ‚Äúwait we have to visualize what 5 choose 2 looks like again.‚Äù
