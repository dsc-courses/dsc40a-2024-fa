- Redo homework and groupwork problems (without looking at the answers, of course). Observe if my approach changed or if I was still getting stuck at the same points as when I first did them. If so, what am I missing and why? If not, hooray! Progress :D
- (In general for math classes) Throughout the quarter, I create a master doc where I write down everything (as concise as possible), organized (ideally sequentially, otherwise poor planning by the instructor) by topic/lecture, and rederive all of the logical steps, including things like:
    - Why are we doing this? <Provide explanation; very important to internalize this!>
    - Any theorems/proofs/derivations, and redoing them + adding my own commentary to supplement, e.g. properties, intermediate algebra steps.
    - Examples, with commentary about what this example is trying to accomplish as an aid to the theoretical concepts.
- Continuing with the above, most of my productive ‚Äústudying‚Äù comes from creating this doc, but sometimes I forget to update it and end up having to do a lot of it closer to the date of an exam; in reality, it‚Äôs podcasts 3x speed, all lecture slides/notes pulled up, coffee, jazz, a lot of facepalming, a lot of LaTeX. I also like having this because after the class is over, I have a nice summary of what the class is about and can easily access my notes. This also works better for me because some notes/slides provided by the instructors are hard for me to work with since I was not involved in the thought process of creating them/are confusing/are difficult to read. 
- If I get stuck, talking things out with classmates/TAs/professors is more efficient than wallowing in course materials solo! Perhaps this is an incentive to start studying earlier so that one can take advantage of office hours + normal waking hours of friends (though I believe one should study by themselves first).
